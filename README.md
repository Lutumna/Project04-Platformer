# Project Name
Project 04 2D Platformer

# Description
This project aims to create a 2D platformer with animations, tilemaps, and MOBS. I went with a "plastic fantasy look" for the aesthetic. I found a knight sprite online and added a more gentle/whimsical music track in the background. I opted to reuse the tileset from the assignments as it provided the toy look I was going for. The game's goal is to collect the coins around the map and move through each level by reaching the flag.

## Implementation
- Features a toyish fantasy appearance
- Movable player that can jump and wall climb
- Multiple enemy types with their own behaviors
- Coins around the levels for players to collect
- There is a score counter that increases when collecting coins
- Music
- Sound effects for jumping and collecting coins
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty both in enemy amount and jumps
  - I tried to include a skill curve for some of the jumps. For instance, a jump may rely on wall jumping first to mimic a vaulting of sorts.
- Animations for the Knight
- A background
- Camera follows the player
